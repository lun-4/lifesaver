Lifesaver is an extremely opinionated bot foundation built on top of
[discord.py@rewrite](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite).

It brings a lot of neat concepts from Disco into Discord.py due to their
general usefulness, like storage and a CLI script to quickly launch bots.

Several pre-made cogs are included in order to help avoid boilerplate.

## Install

```sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/slice/lifesaver
```
